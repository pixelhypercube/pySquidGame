A playable pygame application based on the Netflix Original Drama Series, 'Squid Game'

### Introduction
In Squid Game, there are 6 stages that the players are supposed to play in order, which are:
1. Red Light, Green Light
2. Honeycomb
3. Tug of War
4. Marbles
5. Glass Stepping Stones
6. Squid Game

Traditionally (as seen in the original drama series), players are only allowed to play the next game after they've finished the game they were playing before. However, in this program, you have the privilege of hopping through any game you feel like playing!

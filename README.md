# pySquidGame (beta)
A playable pygame application based of the Netflix Original Drama Series, 'Squid Game'

### Introduction
In Squid Game, there are 6 stages that the players are supposed to play in order, which are:
1. Red Light, Green Light
2. Honeycomb (in development)
3. Tug of War (in development)
4. Marbles (in development)
5. Glass Stepping Stones (in development)
6. Squid Game (in development)

Traditionally (as shown in the original drama series), players are only allowed to play the next game after they've finished the game they were playing before. However, in this program, you have the privilege of hopping through any game you feel like playing!

Unfortunately, 'Red Light Green Light' is the only game that is available to play at the moment as the program is in its early stages of development. Will try to develop more if I have the time! 😊

### Download:
Link: 

### How to run the program:
1. Extract the zip file by double clicking on it
2. Double click on game.exe and start playing!!!

- Unfortunately, game.exe wouldn't work if it's in other directories :( (may try to fix in a next update)
- The buttons may not work 100% correctly - holding down the buttons for a while may do the trick (hopefully...) 🤞

## How to play:

#### Red Light Green Light

Run as fast as possible to the finish line before the time runs out!

When the doll looks at you, freeze! Otherwise, you'll be eliminated!
